                <p>There are many topics that local communities regard as particularly pressing, but journalists usually only discover them by accident. This problem inspired our idea to create a platform where citizensâ€™ concerns can be collected and rated on a municipal level.
                  That way a newspaper can create space for those topics, host a discussion and bring additional value to the local community.
                  The project was found by the <a href="https://www.digitalnewsinitiative.com/">Google Dni Project</a>  </p>
